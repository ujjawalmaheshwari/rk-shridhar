              <h2>RK Sridhar</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
              RK Sridhar (Sridhar Krishnappa) is a young serial entrepreneur and
              social activist from Bengaluru. His journey as a young activist
              and changemaker has been brief but with impact truly demolishing
              the prejudice that age is considered in the Indian society. Always
              standing up against the oppression of any kind, Sridhar’s ideology
              is one - a stronger, independent and sustainable India whom he
              loves because of his instinct and worships because of his
              understanding of India. Quoting Sridhar, “I loved my nation as a
              young boy because of my nationalist attitude but while working for
              my motherland and knowing her with my experience I have started
              worshipping her”. For Sridhar there exists one and only one
              blockage in between ideas and actions, and he defines the blockage
              as an internal stigma and nothing else.

            <h3>Early Days:</h3>
            <p>
              Sridhar is born and brought up in Bengaluru, the capital of
              Karnataka. Belonging to the Thigala Community, culture and
              Hinduism became an internal part of Sridhar’s life. Living the
              epic Mahabharata with the prestigious traditions like ‘Karga’ he
              learnt from the boyhood that the Indian traditions were woven
              around the grand revolution called Vedas fitted in every way for
              every sect and school of thoughts propagating a natural democracy
              among the people. Naturally becoming a Shakta - worshipper of Adi
              Shakthi, Sridhar never refrained from believing in the ideology of
              Shaivas and Vaishnavas equally. Unity in diversity became a part
              and parcel of his everyday life. Done with schooling and
              graduating from an academic brand like Baldwin Sridhar had lesser
              beliefs in the conventional systems and willed to redefine the
              existing systems with his zeal. During his college days he entered
              the realms of college politics while winning the local elections
              without any backgrounds or party-worship as his popularity gained
              the acceleration because of his idealistic nature and being there
              for all attitude

            <h3>One Goal: Upliftment of Society</h3>
            <p>
              RK Sridhar had one goal from the beginning, to work against
              oppression and uplift the masses around. Though struggling with
              his venture already, Sridhar decided to start off upon the path he
              had envisioned forever: to work for one India and the greatest
              India.

                    He started visiting orphanages and old age homes near him
                    and started contributing nearly 20% of his earnings from his
                    venture for the sustainable growth of the organisations
                    working for the underprivileged. Though it was tough for him
                    to match his own ends, he never ceased his beliefs.

                    Gradually his dedication started getting recognized and
                    youngsters of his area started coming together to work with
                    him. He adopted the ways of Shaheed-E-Azam Bhagat Singh and
                    Gandhian ways combined to get in touch with the local masses
                    to fight against oppression while practising Ahimsa and mass
                    movements as solutions.

                    Karnataka and Kannadigas for the first time saw a backbone
                    working for them and their causes. Quoting the organization,
                    “Putting you in control so that you can make informed
                    choices”, the mission, vision and work fell in line. The
                    youth saw for the first time the voice of the average masses
                    getting heard, Karnataka saw interventions on subjects of
                    national importance 2007-08 onwards

                    Sridhar understood that the path ahead can be forged by
                    working at the ground level, working for as well as with the
                    masses of Karnataka with organisational support. Many young
                    men and women had become full-time volunteers dedicating a
                    part of their lives at the grass-root level and hence
                    started a new chapter in his life.

            <h3>Jaya Karnataka</h3>
            <p>
              Joining Jaya Karnataka Sridhar had one aim, to cut down all the
              boundaries and rise as a ‘people’s worker’ independent of
              problems. He started travelling and staying in the remote places
              of Karnataka to understand the people, their problems and
              feasibility of the solutions at hand. His dedicated yet pragmatic
              attitude accompanied with the zeal to solve the problems started
              getting recognized in the ranks of the organization and his
              ability to lead got accepted by everyone.<br /><br />
              Sridhar had always been affected by the problems being faced by
              the feeders of the nation - the farmers of the nation. Clearly,
              Karnataka faces the biggest challenges when it comes to the
              irrigation availabilities and scope to better the same. Mother
              Cauvery and Mother Mahadayi being 2 of the life sources, both face
              a perennial struggle with the neighbouring states Tamil Nadu and
              Goa. Sridhar knew that the betterment will happen only when the
              farmers are represented well at the national level with Civil
              Participation in the movement. The years in between 2016-18 saw a
              growing public agitation against the issue and Sridhar decided to
              peacefully agitate against the sufferings of the farmers by
              bringing together the youth.<br /><br />
              Eventually, the organization decides to give Sridhar the
              reposnibility as the Vice President of Bengaluru District. As a
              people’s person, he didn’t want to come under the limelight but
              when the high command insisted he saw it as a way to practise his
              beliefs better and go forth. The years hence on saw many
              activities from Sridhar’s side including civil non-cooperation
              movement against the Cauvery issue in 2016.<br /><br />
              More than thousands of young activists gathered under the
              leadership of Sridhar to reflect the problems of the farmers
              trying to get public attention nationally. A democratic revolution
              breakthrough happened and nationwide support got recognized.<br /><br />
              Hence on Sridhar got attached more with farmers’ sentiment and
              decided to never stop. Mahadayi had been anothe issue which needed
              the organisational support and this time Sridhar did his part more
              effectively. In no time he assumed the position of the national
              Secretary of Jaya Karnataka, all due to the effective and
              iterative ground work he did by listening and representing the
              farmers. In 2017, a first of its kind national representation got
              made on the Mahadayi issue.<br /><br />
              Many other issues were duly tackled ranging from the employability
              of the youth to the cultural void that Karnataka had been
              suffering from at the national level under the able leadership of
              RK Sridhar. Many youngsters around the state started connecting
              with him, nearly 10,000 youngsters started following the national
              and social shown by Jaya Karnataka and RK Sridhar.<br /><br />
              Many non-identified issues didn’t only get identified but solved
              in the period including a humanitarian issue like of Malai
              Mahadeshwara in 2019 where lack of natural water supply had become
              a question of life and death for the animals in the area.
              Artificial ponds got made with proper water supply to quench the
              thirst of the animals. Understanding the necessity that water is,
              Sridhar developed another aspiration to provide water to the
              needed, animals or humans, at least.<br /><br />
              Hence started another movement of supplying water to the needy all
              across Karnataka, especially around Bengaluru.

            <h3>Entrepreneurial Days:</h3>
            <p>
              From here Sridhar decided to define his own destiny. Special
              influences came form greats like Swami Vivekananda and Dr APJ
              Abdul Kalam, a lifetime decision of becoming a job creator became
              concrete. Having seen and fancied the buildings around him and
              understanding that infrastructural growth means development,
              Sridhar decided to try and succeed as a real estate entrepreneur.
              Starting his career by assisting minor contractors to try to
              understand the business by standing and learning at construction
              sites, 2 to 3 years passed by moulding a young boy into a
              businessman.<br /><br />
              Minor steps create great stories and hence followed the
              never-ending growth of RKS Builders with many futuristic buildings
              and layouts bearing the brand built by a young man. True that
              struggles came into the picture but how have they barred a hard
              worker ever in the history? A prestigious and trusted brand which
              has seen all the thicks and thins, RKS Builders has emerged as a
              synonym to Growing India.
            </p>
            <h3>Hejje:</h3>
            <p>
              It was the need of the hour to go more full-fledged and it was
              only possible with an entrepreneurial move. A step to start off
              with to achieve the same Sridhar founded Hejje in July 2020.
              Gathering together the youth and fellow Social Activists, Hejje
              got registered in August 2020. Yet to start its operations
              formally, Hejje started off a campaign called Amar Parva to
              connect with the families of martyrs and veterans from the Indian
              Armed Forces. Nearly 15 families have been connceted with within a
              month.<br /><br />
              Also, the disrupted education system received an attention from
              Team Hejje and a few solutions are being structured and executed
              to uplift the academic zeal and the spirit of education. Further,
              the plans are too revamp existing Government schools of Karnataka
              to attract the youth. <br /><br />
              Though young Hejje has the ambitious plans to become the voice of
              the voiceless at every front. Independent of associations,
              ideologies and inclinations - Hejje aspires to stand one and
              always with Karnataka and India.
